# Soy-and-Alternative-Products
## Introduction
At the beginning, the class sampled two different kinds of *Synergy Kombucha*, a strawberry flavored *Kefir*, and a *Chocolate Soy Milk*. The class also sampled *Soy Cheese* Different groups in seperate kitchens each prepared varieties of foods with protein alternatives: soy, tofu, quinoa, etc. Five variations of meatloaf were prepared, each with different amounts (and color) of Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP).

After the preparation of the foods designated to each group, the class evaluated all the foods. The foods include: Edamame with Kosher Salt, Quorn Chicken Product, Meatloaf with no TVP, Meatloaf 1/4 c TVP, Meatloaf 1/2 c TVP, Tofu Stir Fry, Hummus, Peanut Butter Pudding (with Tofu), Tofu Spinach Quiche, Tofu Macaroni and Cheese, and a Bruschetta Quinoa Casserole. 
## Methods
At the beginning of class, we first tried a strawberry Kefir, two kinds of Synergy Kombucha, and a Chocolate Soy milk and recorded the appearance, aroma, flavor, texture, and consistency.
After we completed the beverage charting, we passed around a plate of Soy Cheese and recorded the appearance, aroma, flavor, texture, and consistency of the cheese as we did with the beverages. 
Next, we then separated into individual kitchens. 

In Kitchen 5, my partner and I first prepared Meatloaf Variation A using dark TVP. 
First, we pre-heated the oven. 
In a separate mixing bowl, we added ¼ cup dark TVP and ¼ cup water and let it stand for 10 minutes. 
The dried onion, bread crumbs, tomato sauce, and salt were already measured and combined in a mixing bowl for us. 
We beat the egg and added it to the prepared mixture as well as the pre-weighed meat. 
While waiting for the TVP to stand, we weighed the weight of the pan; it weighed 4.6ounces. 
After the TVP stood for 10 minutes we added it to the meat mixture and mixed well. 
We then placed the mixture in a small loaf pan and spread it out evenly along the pan. 
After the meat mixture was spread, we covered with ¼ cup BBQ Sauce and weighed the pan and the meat; it weighed 1lb 10.4ounces. 
We placed the loaf man with meatloaf in oven for 30 minutes. 
When the timer went off, we took the temperature of the meatloaf to ensure it reached the proper temperature of 155 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. 
We weighed the pan after it cooled slightly, and it weighed 1lb 8.9oz

**The Percent Yield was 94.5%**

We then prepared the Bruschetta Quinoa Casserole; the quinoa was pre-cooked for us. 
My partner first coated the 8x8 baking dish with Olive Oil and Garlic pieces.
While she was doing so, I heated oil in a saucepan on medium heat. As the oil was heating, I chopped the onion. Once the onion was finely chopped, I added it to the heated oil and let saute for five minutes. After five minutes, I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and let saute for a minute more to allow the mixture to become fragrant. After reaching desired fragrance, I added an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce and let simmer for a couple minutes. 
While I was simmering the sauce, my partner combined the cooked quinoa with 1 cup uncooked quinoa, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon oregano, and a pinch of black pepper and toasted it for 2 minutes. 
She halved the cherry tomatoes while it was toasting. 
After my sauce had simmered, I set aside (off heat) and added ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese and stirred. 
After I finished stirring the cheese into the sauce, we were ready to combine the quinoa mixture my partner had been working on with the sauce I had been preparing. My partner then added ½ cup of mozzarella cheese, ½ cup of the cherry tomato halves, ½ amount of torn basil leaves and ½ teaspoon of salt. 
We mixed together and placed in the oil and garlic rubbed 8x8 baking dish. 
We placed the remaining cherry tomatoes on top and sprinkled the other ½ cup of mozzarella cheese on top and placed in the oven (heated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit) and baked 15-20 minutes. 
After the timer went off, I cracked the oven door slightly and set the oven to broil and let it broil for 2 minutes so the cheese would bubble. 
After it broiled for 2 minutes, I let it stand for 5 minutes and then served it. 
When we placed the Bruschetta Quinoa Casserole in the oven, we took the Quorn Chicken Product out of their bags and placed on a light colored baking sheet together and placed in already pre-heated oven set on 400 degrees and cooked for 16 minutes. 
Once the 16 minutes were up, I quartered the patties and placed the quartered patties and the nuggets on a serving dish and served. 
As a class, we then all tried the various foods prepared and charted their appearance, aroma, flavor, texture, and consistency.
## Results and Conclusion
I couldn’t really tell a difference in the meatloaves with different amounts of TVP. They all tasted the same to me. I did learn that I am not a fan of Kombucha because its very vinegary and very bitter to me. But the Kefir wasn’t bad which was surprising to me because I don’t typically enjoy the texture or taste of yogurt and it was similar to yogurt. The Soy Milk tasted a little watery to me but wasn’t the taste I was expecting at all. It 
tasted almost like regular chocolate milk. The Tofu I was skeptical of because I had always heard the majority of people say they didn’t like it and that it was gross. But there was tofu in the vegetables, the quiche, the pudding, and the macaroni and I couldn’t really tell a distinct flavor for it, and if I did it wasn’t strong, and I still liked all the items that contained the tofu. 
Overall, there are a lot of soy and alternative products for proteins that actually don’t taste bad at all and it was cool to see the different ways soy could be used.
